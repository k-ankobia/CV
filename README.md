##### RC Self Driving Car

- Built a real-time autonomous navigation toy car by prototyping a platform to test machine learning algorithms. It successfully traversed an obstacle course through a combination of robotics and computer vision.

- Programmed a supervised training model via neural networks to train and successfully classify images for navigation. Microcontroller programming using an Arduino and circuit design was used to manipulate a suitable combination of sensors and hardware for driving. A camera feed on the car captured data sets and software was developed to transform data to the right level of granularity for analysis using neural networks to generate and test the model.
