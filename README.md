- Recently completed full stack development course with Makers Academy 
- MEng. in Electrical & Electronic Engineering with relevant modules in computer science
- As a tech enthusiast, I’ve built electronics from burglar alarms to autonomous radio controlled cars
- As an Electrical Engineering Consultant, I've contributed to projects such as [London Fruit & Wool Exchange](http://newlondondevelopment.com/nld/project/london_fruit_and_wool_exchange_e1) 

### Background 

My fondest memories as a child were typing DOS commands on a laptop to play video games and tinkering with computers electronics to understand how they work. I fueled this passion when I studied MEng Electronics & Electrical Engineering at university. During my time, I built DIY homebrew electronics projects and designed hardware/software to compete in robotics competitions. 

I worked as an engineering consultant after graduating however it was slow-paced, lacked creativity and I wasn’t contributing to solving new problems. l  spent the last year exploring London’s tech meetups, attending hackathons, [Codebar events](https://codebar.io/), tech talks and started self-teaching software. I decided to accelerate my learning through [makers academy bootcamp](https://makers.tech/fellowship/). Although my core competencies are in ruby and javascript. I am driven by my passion for technology and crave innovation. My career in engineering has equipped me with a pragmatic approach to problem-solving.

## Skills

#### Examples of using industy practices to complete projects: 


- **Agile:** [JunglBook](https://github.com/k-ankobia/Acebook-Simian-Sinister), [Fashion Finder](https://github.com/k-ankobia/fashion-finder) - Pair programming, Scrum, Sprint planning 
- **Test- Driven Development:** [Bank-Tech-Test](https://github.com/k-ankobia/Bank_tech_test_) - Feature tests, Unit Tests, 100% Test Coverage
- **Unit Testing:** [Airport challenge](https://github.com/k-ankobia/Airport_challenge_portfolio), [10-Minute-Walk](https://github.com/k-ankobia/10MinuteWalk/blob/master/README.md) 
- **Automated testing/ Deployment**  - [JungleBook](https://github.com/k-ankobia/Acebook-Simian-Sinister) - Continous integration using Travis 

#### Problem Solving 
- My degree and previous roles required me to be a creative problem solver and analytical thinker. I have applied technical skills in digital logic design, software and hardware to implement solutions to challenges. 
- I Honed my systematic approach to solving new problems using good industry practices at makers academy. 


#### Excellent Communicator
- Working as an engineering consultant, I liaised with stakeholders and designed engineering solutions to meet the scope of their requirements. This meant communicating with contractors that were building my designs to sitting in client meetings with non-technical directors.
- I Enjoy working in a collaborative environment where new ideas are valued. During my time at makers, my team utilised stand-ups and retros.  


#### Adaptive Learner
- I can work autonomously as demonstrated by my taking initiative to self-teach python, javascript, C to deliver electronics projects & build automation tools. 
- I'm language agnostic and can apply software patterns/principles in rails, javascript, react to deliver makers academy projects. 
- Passion to learn exciting modern technologies with an experience working with web development stack and hardware electronics. 

## Education 

#### Software Developer Bootcamp: Makers Academy (2019)

Makers Academy honed my skills in applying a systematic approach to solving new problems using industry-best practices. I gained a rigorous understanding of Test-Driven Development.

#### Technologies

- Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Node, React, Python
- RSpec, Jasmine, Cypress, Pytest
- Express, Jquery, Ajax, Sinatra, HTML & CSS
- Postgres, MongoDB, Firebase, Sequelize 


#### MEng in Electronics & Electrical Engineering: Loughborough University ( 2012 - 2017) 
Relevant modules: Software & Programming, Computer Security, Digital Electronics & Computer Networks.

Studying MEng Electronics & Electrical engineering developed my creative problem solving and analytical skills. These are exemplified in my final year project, for which I applied technical skills in digital logic design, software and hardware to build a [remote-controlled autonomous car](https://github.com/k-ankobia/RC-Self-Driving-Car). This is a short [video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rWsGbreprwUARD_Q6gX9LB-A1tzIUAPa) of the project in action



## Professional experience

#### Electrical Engineering Consultant ( 2015 - 2016 Placement, 2017 – 2018 Graduate )
During my 2.5 years working as an engineering consultant at AECOM, ranked number 1 in the Engineering News Record, I liaised with stakeholders and designed engineering solutions to meet the scope of their requirements.

- Collaborated with Engineers, Contractors and Architects to design of electrical infrastructure for commercial building projects.
- Developed models and calculations to carry out load assessment, cost planning, circuiting and security to deliver effective professional services and drive efficient solutions.
- Took ownership of electrical design and created effective 3D models to support calculations of the 285,000 sq ft ‘Beagle House’ infrastructure development scheme using building modelling software. 
- Chaired meetings with clients/stakeholders for requirements gathering.

#### CITI Bank Business Internship - Technology Intern    (July 2012 – August 2012)

- Gained experience on the transparency of how technology support functions that underpin the revenue earners.
